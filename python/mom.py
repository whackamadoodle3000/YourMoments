prompt = """

we are writing a 6 part screenplay loosely based on the above transcript of a real audio transcript. The screenplay will have 6 distinct scenes, each 10 seconds long. For 3 of these scenes, you will write a 3rd person limited narration. For the remaining 3, the original real audio will be kept. Select which 3 are narrated over, and which 3 are kept, to your liking. Ensure that the entire 6 part scene has a coherent and interesting storyline, full of exciting twists and turns that will entertain the audience! Consider drama such as a divorce, a murder, a spy noir film, a regal ball, an affair, or a robbery happening. However, don't choose more than one and overcomplicate the story. Also, you DO NOT always have to choose one. Note that the storyline MUST be coherent and very easy to follow.  Include transition words when possible. Each scene has to transition to the next scene in a way that makes sense.
Here are more concrete limitations:
For the 3 scenes that have the 3rd person narration, they should only be 1-2 sentences long.
For all 6 scenes, format your output for each scene as an element, inside of a Python list of 6 elements. Each element will have 2 elements nested inside, which will be NARRATION or TRANSCRIPT and then the actual text. For example, I may have element 1 be ["narration", "A bustling hospital hallway. A man named Nathan faces a daunting line."] 

Format output as follows, WITH CORRECT PYTHON SYNTAX FOR A NESTED LIST:
[["xxx", "xxx"],
    ["xxx", "xxx"],
    ["xxx", "xxx"],
    ["xxx", xxx"],
    ["xxx", "xxx"],
    ["xxx", "xxx"]]

DO NOT output any additional code, comments, words, symbols, or anything at all. Keep the output very strict to the provided format above. ONLY RESPOND WITH THE OUTPUT.
